# CIFAR-10_NeuralNetwork
A convolutional neural network trained for the CIFAR-10 image corpus.

Introduction:
The provided code demonstrates the process of loading, preprocessing, and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model on the CIFAR-10 dataset using TensorFlow. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images belonging to ten different classes. The code u7lizes the TensorFlow framework to define the CNN architecture, compile the model, train it on the training data, and evaluate its performance on the test data.

Detailed Descrip)on:
The code begins by importing the necessary libraries: tensorflow for building and training the model, pickle for loading the dataset, and numpy for data manipula7on. The code defines the data_dir variable, which holds the path to the directory containing the CIFAR-10 dataset.

The training data is loaded and preprocessed. It iterates over five training batches using a for loop and opens each batch file using pickle.load(). The images and labels are extracted from the batch dictionary and appended to the train_data and train_labels lists, respectively.

The train_data is then reshaped and transposed to match the expected input shape of the CNN model. Each image is reshaped to (32, 32, 3) and the dimensions are rearranged from (batch_size, 3, 32, 32) to (batch_size, 32, 32, 3).
The test data is loaded and preprocessed in a similar manner to the training data. The images are reshaped and transposed to match the input shape of the CNN model.

The data is normalized by dividing each pixel value by 255.0 to scale the pixel intensities between 0 and 1.
The CNN model architecture is defined using the S.keras.Sequen7al() API. It consists of several convolu7onal layers, batch normalization layers, max-pooling layers,dropout layers, and dense layers. The architecture follows a pattern of alterna7ng convolu7onal and batch normaliza7on layers, with max-pooling and dropout layers interspersed to reduce overfixing.

The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer, sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function, and accuracy metric using the model.compile() method.

The model is trained using the model.fit() method. The training data and labels are passed as arguments along with the batch size and the number of epochs to train for. Addi7onally, the test data and labels are provided as the validation data to monitor the model's performance during training.
 
After training completes, the model is evaluated on the test data using the model.evaluate() method. The test loss and test accuracy are calculated and stored in the variables test_loss and test_acc, respectively.

Finally, the test loss and test accuracy are printed to the console using the print() function.


Results:
  
The results from the code show the training and valida7on performance of the CNN model on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Here is an analysis of the results:

Training Process: The model was trained for 50 epochs, with each epoch consis7ng of several steps. The training loss and accuracy are reported for each epoch. The training loss starts at 1.7641 and gradually decreases with each epoch, indica7ng that the model is learning and improving its predic7ons. The training accuracy starts at 41.88% and increases consistently, reaching 98.74% at the end of training. Valida)on Process: The valida7on loss and accuracy are reported for each epoch. The valida7on loss starts at 3.4038 and decreases steadily over the epochs, indica7ng that the model generalizes well to unseen data. The valida7on accuracy starts at 16.73% and increases consistently, reaching 87.54% at the end of training. Overfi;ng: The model shows some signs of overfiXng, as the training accuracy is higher than the valida7on accuracy. This is evident from around epoch 12, where the training accuracy starts to approach 100% while the valida7on accuracy plateaus. This suggests that the model is memorizing the training data and may not generalize well to new, unseen data.

Performance: The final test accuracy achieved by the model is 87.54%, which is reasonably good considering the complexity of the CIFAR-10 dataset. The test loss is 0.6167, indicating that the model makes relatively accurate predictions.

Training Time: The training process takes a significant amount of time for each epoch, ranging from a few minutes to several hours. This may be due to the complexity of the model and the size of the CIFAR-10 dataset.

TensorFlow Warnings: The TensorFlow library generates some warnings related to CPU optimiza7on instructions, suggesting that the current TensorFlow binary may not be fully optimized for the CPU on which the code is running. This does not affect the overall results or the performance of the model.

Overall, the results indicate that the CNN model is able to learn and classify the CIFAR-10 images with good accuracy. However, addressing the issue of overfiXng could potentially improve the model's performance and generalization capability. Additionally, optimizing the training time would be beneficial, especially if working with larger datasets or more complex models.
